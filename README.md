# Layout Control

Sublime Text-like columns/rows/grid layout shortcuts and commands for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

- Use **cmd+alt+\[n\]** (where n is a number between 1 and 4) to set the layout to n columns.
- Use **cmd+shift+alt+\[n\]** (where n is 2 or 3) for n rows.
- Use **cmd+alt+5** for a 4 panes grid.

E.g. cmd+alt+3 will create a 3 columns layout.
